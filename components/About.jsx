          I started my programming journey at my university. I studied programming concepts and data structure at the start by learning Python ,Java, Javascript. Then, I learned how to develop software applications in the real world by using new tech stacks and frameworks.
I have hands-on experience in building projects from zero, engineering production applications and making them better.
